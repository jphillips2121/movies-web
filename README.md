# Movies-Web: Web Application for displaying movie data from the [movies-api](https://github.com/jphillips2121/movies-api)

## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org)

## Running the application locally

Before running the SpringBoot app locally ensure that the [movies-api](https://github.com/jphillips2121/movies-api) is running on your machine. Details can be found in the README of the movies-api app. 

Once that is done, use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) and type the following into the command line to get the web app to run: 

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```
